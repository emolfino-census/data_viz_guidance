# Pie Chart

**Also known as:** Circle chart

## Purpose and Overview

A pie chart presents values as wedges of a circle, with each wedge representing a share of a whole.

Pie charts are familiar, but readers can find it difficult to compare wedge sizes, especially when categories have similar values. Consider a bar chart, stacked bar chart, table, donut chart, or directly displayed numbers before choosing a pie chart. A donut chart is another part-to-whole display, not a solution to every comparison problem.

## When to Use

* The main question concerns how a small number of categories contribute to one whole.
* The categories are mutually exclusive and together cover the whole.
* Broad differences in shares matter more than precise comparisons between similar values.
* The chart can remain near three or four slices.

## When to Use an Alternative

* Use another display when readers need precise comparisons, when there are many categories, or when shares are similar.
* Avoid using several pie charts to compare places, groups, or time periods. A display with a common baseline is usually easier to compare.
* Do not use a pie chart for overlapping categories or values that do not form one meaningful whole.

## Choosing Between Alternatives

| Analytical Goal | Alternative Visualization | Why It May Be Preferable |
|---|---|---|
| Compare category values or similar shares precisely | Bar chart | Lengths on a common baseline are easier to compare than angles. |
| Compare composition across groups | Stacked bar chart | Shows the groups together without requiring comparisons between separate circles. |
| Provide exact values and uncertainty | Table | Readers can look up detailed values directly. |
| Communicate one or two key values | Directly displayed numbers | Avoids an unnecessary chart. |
| Use a circular part-to-whole layout | Donut chart | Provides space for a central label, although similar slice-comparison limitations remain. |

## Data Requirements and Statistical Considerations

* Define the whole, including its population, geography, reference period, and units.
* Use mutually exclusive categories that together account for the whole. The underlying shares should total 100 percent; explain any differences caused by rounding.
* If small categories are combined, explain the grouping and keep the original categories available in a data table.
* Explain missing or suppressed values. Do not treat them as zero or silently redefine the whole by excluding them.
* When appropriate, provide measures of uncertainty and identify the measure used. See the Visualizing Uncertainty guidance.
* If statistical significance is indicated with patterns or other markings, explain what those markings mean. Do not rely on color alone.

## Visualization-Specific Considerations

### Essential Requirements

* Include a legend or label wedges directly.
* Make clear what each wedge represents and what constitutes the whole.
* Provide descriptive alt text and an accessible data table.
* Do not use three-dimensional effects, which distort perceived wedge sizes.

### Recommended Practices

* Stay near three or four slices. Consider a bar chart when more categories are needed.
* Use distinguishable colors and consider outlines or patterns to help separate wedges.
* Include category names and shares so readers do not have to interpret color alone.
* Follow the related Agency Logo, Color, Legends, Notes, Sources, Titles, Typography, and 508 Compliance guidance where applicable.

### Practices to Avoid

* Do not use large gaps between wedges, as in an exploded pie chart.
* Do not use multi-level pies or nested donut rings when they make the display difficult to interpret.
* Do not rely on comparisons between separate pie charts when a bar chart would make the differences clearer.
* Do not imply that a small visual difference establishes statistical significance.

## Census Data Example

### How Maryland workers got to work, 2025

## An accessible example

This example is a part-to-whole chart. It uses four slices, because this page recommends staying near three or four. The smallest published ways of getting to work are added together in the last slice. The table under the chart lists each of those published numbers on its own.

The picture description states the result. The caption names the chart. The source line starts with "Source: U.S. Census Bureau." The same numbers are in a table that opens from the keyboard.

### Ownership share of all businesses by sex, 2021

This chart is drawn from the Census Bureau's 2021 Nonemployer Statistics by Demographics company summary. It counts employer and nonemployer firms. Each pie shows firms owned by women, owned equally by men and women, owned by men, or unclassifiable. States sit in a tile grid near their places on a map, and a larger pie shows the United States. The number under each name is every firm in that place. The same counts are in the table.

#### Reproduce the ownership example

To draw this picture again, from the project folder:
```
export CENSUS_API_KEY=your_key_here
python3 examples/family_d/make_ownership_pies.py
```

<a href="{{ '/examples/family_d/make_ownership_pies.py' | relative_url }}">Download the Python script</a>. It needs Python 3 and the matplotlib package. Leave the key out of the program and the saved table. If `CENSUS_API_KEY` is not set, the program tries the Census Data API once and otherwise uses `examples/family_d/absnesd_2021_firms_by_sex.csv`.

#### Related interactive visualization

The related interactive chart is [Ownership Share of All Businesses by Demographics on census.gov](https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/interactive/ownership-share-of-businesses-by-demographics.html).

Its legend and hover details provide additional information, including values and margins of error. Hover details can supplement a chart, but essential information should also be available to keyboard and touchscreen users.

This example uses multiple pies arranged geographically. Consider a bar chart when the main task is precise comparison between places.

## Developer Implementation

The ownership example's Python instructions appear with that example above. The following instructions reproduce the Maryland commute chart.

### Reproduce the Maryland commute example

<a href="{{ '/examples/family_d/make_md_commute_chart.py' | relative_url }}">Download the Python script</a>. It saves the Maryland commute chart. It needs Python 3 and the matplotlib package.

To download the live 2025 estimates, request a free Census Data API key at https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html and set it in your terminal. Leave the key out of the program, this page, and the saved table:

```
export CENSUS_API_KEY=your_key_here
python3 examples/family_d/make_md_commute_chart.py
```

If `CENSUS_API_KEY` is not set, the program uses the saved file `examples/family_d/md_b08301_means_of_transportation.csv`. Those numbers were copied from the published table on November 8, 2026. The live 2025 values for Maryland match that file: 3,179,937 workers in total, 2,429,541 by car, truck, or van, 174,860 by public transportation, and 435,692 who worked from home.

<details class="code-details">
<summary><span class="code-details-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span>Show Python code for the commute chart</summary>
{% highlight python %}
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Draw a part-to-whole chart of how Maryland workers got to work.

The numbers are published Census estimates for American Community Survey
2025 1-year table B08301, Maryland (FIPS 24), workers 16 years and over.
Published table: https://data.census.gov/table/ACSDT1Y2025.B08301?g=040XX00US24

To download the live estimates, set a Census Data API key in the environment.
Do not paste the key into this file:

    export CENSUS_API_KEY=your_key_here
    python3 examples/family_d/make_md_commute_chart.py

If CENSUS_API_KEY is not set, the program uses the saved estimates in
md_b08301_means_of_transportation.csv. Those saved numbers were copied from
the published table on 2026-11-08. The live API values for the total,

### Accessibility Review

Use this list before publishing a pie chart. More requirements are on the [508 compliance](508.html) page.

* Say what the chart means in the picture description, and include the main numbers.
* Give the chart a caption that says what it is about.
* Start the source line with "Source: U.S. Census Bureau," then name the survey, the year, and the table.
* Put the same numbers in a table with a title and column headings. A reader should be able to open that table with the keyboard.
* Write the name and percent for every slice. Color can help, but it cannot be the only way to tell the slices apart.
* Choose colors that people with color blindness can tell apart, and give text a contrast of at least 4.5 to 1.
* Stay near four slices. In this example the smallest modes are added together, and each published number is still listed in the table.
* Do not use 3D effects or exploded slices. They make the sizes harder to judge.

## Common Errors and Misinterpretations

| Issue | Why It Matters | Recommended Correction |
|---|---|---|
| Categories overlap or do not cover the whole | Wedge sizes imply a part-to-whole relationship that the data do not support. | Use mutually exclusive categories covering the whole, or choose another chart. |
| Too many slices or similar shares | Readers struggle to compare wedge sizes. | Use a bar chart or simplify categories with a documented grouping. |
| Missing or suppressed values are omitted without explanation | The displayed shares may imply a different whole. | Explain the missing information and avoid silently rescaling the remaining categories. |
| Several pies are used for precise comparisons | Readers must compare angles across separate circles. | Consider bars with a common baseline. |
| 3D effects or exploded slices distort the display | Perceived wedge sizes can differ from the data. | Use a flat chart without large gaps. |
| Color or hover is the only way to obtain information | Some readers cannot identify categories or access details. | Provide labels, descriptive alt text, and an accessible data table. |
| A visual difference is treated as statistically significant | Readers may draw conclusions unsupported by the estimates. | Provide relevant uncertainty and explain any significance testing. |
